    <h1>Enkrip</h1>
   <p class="text-start">This project is a fully responsive light-weight mobile friendly Flask powered website about the field of cryptography, where you can find all sorts of tools and information about ciphers, encryptions; cryptography in general. In this website, I used the Flask framework and Bootstrap for the styling. I first had the inspiration from week 2 Substition problem set, where I took an interest in how cryptography works. This website includes tools like GPT instructor from OpenAI API that answers most cryptographic questions in detail, and also other types of questions if you wish to ask the AI, I configured the instructor to be cost efficient but still answers in detail. There are also encryptions and decryptions using the Fernet cryptographic recipe from the python Cryptography library. This website also includes ciphers information which people can read how it works, and how secure it is; there is also an articles page that I plan to expand on. In terms of styling, I went with a monochrome theme, the images on this website are all AI generated with Microsoft's Image Creator, including the icon!</p>
   <p class="text-start">This project will serve as the beginning of my cryptographic knowledge journey that I plan to embark on further; the more my knowledge increases in this field, the more I will update this project, so it's kind of like my notes for the cryptography subject!</p>
   <p class="text-start">The goal of this project is to provide the community about cryptography information, as I see not a lot of people have information about this subject; to educate myself and other people through this website. With the rise of quantum computing and AI, I see there is a growing need for people to know more about cryptography. Its significant importance in computer security, makes it an important subject to learn for the sake of the future. I will add an indonesian translated version of the websitem also in the future; because majority of indonesians don't know english very well!</p>
