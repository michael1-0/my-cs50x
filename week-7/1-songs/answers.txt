We could assume things like Energy, Danceability, Valence and Tempo
make what we call Audio Aura; the values of those that are high mean the song
is on the positive side and low values of those variables mentioned mean the audio aura
is more negative.

But, we don't have many samples of songs only 100, which might not be enough to
determine the type of Aura. And just because a song has low Valence, Energy and danceability
it does not mean user is not uplifted by that song.
